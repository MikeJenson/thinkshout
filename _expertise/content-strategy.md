With decades of experience under our belt working for and on behalf of nonprofits and mission-driven organizations, we understand that you need to not only raise more money and attract new supporters, but simultaneously maintain your current base and move them up the ladder of engagement. That doesn’t happen by accident - it takes careful planning, and most importantly: time. We are here to do the heavy lifting so that you can focus on the day-to-day tasks that keep your organization up and running.

Our offerings are designed to address common pain points for nonprofits that we have either seen or experienced first-hand. We know what it’s like to be in your shoes, and we want to make your life easier.

We’re not going to pretend we can learn everything about your work in a single day, or even weeks. That’s why we’re your partner every step of the way, co-developing the final product that will help deepen the impact you can make.

It  always starts with a conversation and evolves into follow-up discussions to curate a mutual understanding of the organizational goals central to the success of your site or campaign, as well as ensuring we engage the core audiences you want to reach.

#### Website Audit and Metrics Evaluation<a name=webaudit></a>

*Unsure if users are engaging with key content?  
Donations or email sign ups have plateaued?  
Never closely examined user behavior on your site?*

Start with a **Website Audit and Metrics Evaluation**

Successful strategies depend on more than just gut instinct. ThinkShout’s practice begins by looking at the data and the concept of “desire paths.” Recognizing that people want to take the shortest path to meet their own needs allows us to identify gaps and potential improvements in the information architecture of a site, even as we collect the data that will inform our later understanding of your online audiences. 

Google analytics shows us what users are actually doing and what content they’re engaging with, as well as what they’re not as interested in. Then we ask how these findings align with your goals. We work to bridge the gap between user needs and getting them to take valuable actions you want them to take to support your mission.

This initial work is foundational to the metrics and evaluation work done over the course of our projects – both to define what success looks like and to provide clear guidance on how to make and test incremental improvements over time.

#### Communications Audit<a name=commaudit></a>

*Emails under-performing?  
Open and Click through rates dropping?  
Unsubscribe rates on the rise?  
Are you reacting rather than being proactive about your messages?*

We can help with a **Communications Audit.**

Sometimes, you just need to get an email out the door because you realized #GivingTuesday is in a week (we’ve all been there). But it’s impossible to improve and refine your strategy if you’re always reacting to what’s next rather than planning for it.

We understand that organizations frequently operate on limited resources, but successful marketing plans don’t happen by accident - it takes planning and focused effort. It can be both difficult and frustrating to make improvements when there’s barely time to focus on the next outbound message. ThinkShout can assist with a communications audit that examines current processes and identify easy wins and strategies to help elevate your messaging to get the results you desire. 

Once we know your goals, we set the framework for your digital plan and work with you to ensure every step of the user experience is accounted for.

#### Digital Marketing and Acquisition<a name=mktgstrat></a>

*Struggling to attract traffic to your site?  
Users not interacting with your content?  
Site traffic trending downwards?  
Attracting users, but email lists aren’t growing?*

Let’s look at your **Digital Marketing and Acquisition.**

Whether it’s building general brand awareness, a seasonal promotion, a local Day of Giving, or a major capital campaign — you need to do more than toss up a Facebook post and swap out the hero image on your home page. Successful campaigns amplify your cause, attracting new supporters and re-engaging current ones. 

We work with organizations to set strategies with a low-barrier of entry to users so the benefits of connecting to your cause are evident.

With decades of experience running multi-channel fundraising and brand-awareness campaigns at the national and local scale, we’re well-positioned to elevate your message. And our engagement doesn’t end at launch, we’ll work with you to ensure actions and outcomes are measurable so you can report back to your board and leadership team with confidence. From campaign concept to deployment, we are here to serve as your resource and guides in whatever capacity you desire.


#### Online Fundraising and Campaigns<a name=campaign></a>

*Want to raise morem oney, from more individuals, with greater frequency?  
Want to increase your pool of monthly donors/sustainers?  
Feel like you're doing everything right, but the dollars don't add up?*

Let's examine your **Fundraising Strategy.**

Our strategists started their careers in development/fundraising departments at nonprofits. Successful fundraising campaigns are part art, part science, and finding the right balance between the two. And it’s about much more than a beautiful, slick campaign landing page. People choose to support your cause because they trust you’ll make good use of their investment. How do you nurture a relationship with hundreds, thousands, or even just 20 individuals on your list?

If your audience doesn’t trust you, or know how you’ll use their funds to affect change, they’ll be less likely to be advocates for your cause. That trust comes from frequent, open communication that closes the loop on past campaigns and updates users on milestones that have been met -- thanks to them. We work with our clients to help them build communication plans that will cultivate strong relationships with their users that will stand the test of time.

Prior to arriving at ThinkShout, members of our team raised millions of dollars for organizations implementing strategies predicated on this knowledge; and executed them with the systems and tools that allowed those efforts to succeed. Let’s start a conversation about your goals and audiences, and how we can bridge the gap to make your mission one of the top causes they support.


#### Content Strategy<a name=constrat></a>

At its basest level, content strategy for nonprofit websites is simple: provide great content and clear pathways to deeper engagement and your supporters will reward you by becoming lifelong activists and donors.

In practice, however, that simple idea branches out to reflect the various online audiences and their diverse reasons for arriving at a website in the first place – particularly when their motivations are far afield from an organization’s goals.

We believe content strategy hinges on understanding three things:

* Organizational goals;
* The organization’s audiences and their motivations; and
* The content that connects the two, with strong regard for how users find and access it.

We’ve developed and refined a set of practices that not only define and codify organizational content strategy, but set the stage for a technical implementation.

#### Campaign Assets and Design<a name=design></a>

We pride ourselves on our ability to craft strong, clean designs that deliver a cohesive and pleasant user experience. Your strategy and outreach materials often require accompanying graphics. Whether it’s repurposing content from your direct mail outreach or coming up with a revised brand identity for a campaign, our designers are equipped to guide the discussion to assess how we can best serve you.

Marketing campaigns can have two prongs: 
1. Reinforce the brand itself with a clear message, which communicates your mission and immediate goals.
2. The campaign itself has its own unique branding supported by organizational branding.

Out staff staff has a wealth of experience in both areas and can provide assets such as:

* Email Design
* Digital Banner Ads
* Campaign Graphics: hero images, social media, general website graphics
* Supporting printed materials

For a uniquely branded campaign, we would extend the scope of work to encompass more of a traditional discovery engagement. This can include the following campaign branding elements:
 
* Logo
* Branding graphics/imagery
* Pairing the campaign with the current existing brand

Your brand identity speaks to your organization's mission and resonates with the motivations of your online audiences. We approach design collaboratively, centered on adaptive, mobile-first content.

Visual aesthetic completes the success of a digital experience. Through clean design, pleasing typography, and bold imagery, we bring your content to life and make it accessible to all audiences that come into contact with your mission.
