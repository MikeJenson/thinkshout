Over the last 15 years or so, we’ve seen consistent growth in nonprofits’ appreciation for how open source tools can support their goals for online engagement. The immediate benefits of implementing an open source solution are clear:

* With open source tools, organizations avoid costly licensing fees.
* Open source tools are generally easier to customize.
* Open source tools often have stronger and more diverse vendor/support options.
* Open source platforms are often better suited for integration with other tools and services.

And we know open source. Our developers have invested thousands of hours into improving nonprofit capacity through open source work, to the point that our contributions now power more than 50,000 websites.

#### Drupal Development

While we do not settle on recommending a particular technology until we have completed the requirements gathering process, we generally believe that Drupal is the ideal open source platform for nonprofit websites.

ThinkShout is a recognized leader in Drupal development. When software companies like Salesforce and MailChimp seek to integrate their work with Drupal, they turn to us. And because we work almost exclusively with nonprofits, we are uniquely positioned to understand their needs; across our staff, we even have years of experience working FOR nonprofits.

It is this intimate knowledge of our clients that have driven some of our most significant contributions to the nonprofit open source space.

#### Association Management Solutions

RedHen, our Drupal-native CRM, was initially designed to meet [common nonprofit needs]({{site.baseurl}}/expertise/engagement-tools/). It has classic CRM functionality for managing information about contacts, organizations, and their relationships between each other and our clients (like memberships).

#### Peer-to-Peer Fundraising

Built on top of RedHen, our donation management solution supports unlimited one-page donation forms tied directly to your payment processor (and CRM). We’ve extended that functionality to support a peer-to-peer fundraising system. RedHen Raiser is an open source solution that rivals commercial platforms like Razoo and Crowdrise in functionality.

#### Event Management and Ticketing

We know many nonprofits generate support and donations by holding events, so we wrote a module to bring that functionality into any Drupal-powered website. Entity Registration allows our clients to handle events registrations simply and flexibly. It not only allows for fee-based registrations, but can be extended to collect additional information along the way, like shoe-size for a bowling event.

#### Online Mapping

Visualizing data helps our clients create meaning and engagement with their online audiences. By leveraging the Drupal “geo stack” of Leaflet and Geofield, we’ve helped nonprofits across the country better tell their stories.

But we haven’t stopped there. The full list of our contributions demonstrates our commitment to open source software that supports the needs of nonprofits. [Check out our full list of open source contributions.]({{site.baseurl}}/expertise/open-source/)
