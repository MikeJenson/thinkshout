If you could work for a company that offered only one of these options, which would you choose?

* A tech company that helps nonprofits leverage technology to work more effectively
* A tech company that has competitive wages and a great work/life balance
* A tech company with an amazing company culture

What if there was a company that offered all three?

We’re ThinkShout and we find creative and innovative ways to design and develop software that helps nonprofits and organizations promoting social good to fulfill their missions.

We’re looking for a sales operation manager to help us expand our mission to help nonprofits and  organizations grow and succeed.

## Sales Operations Manager

Your goal in this position is to grow ThinkShout’s overall impact and revenue in the nonprofit space. In your first three months, you’ll focus on mastering sales operations management, learning our ProsperWorks CRM, staying on top of our lead gen timelines, and assisting with proposal development. Once you’re excelling in these areas, you’ll focus on new business by dividing your time between:

* Sales Operations Management - maintaining leads and opportunities from the web and conferences through our CRM, generating reports, and refining our sales process
* Lead Gen – identifying prospective clients, attending community engagement events, and finding new RFP opportunities
* Proposal and Presentation Development – assisting the CSO and strategy team in the development and delivery of sales proposals

The best sales operation managers are:

* Motivated – they’re inspired by the company’s vision and dive in to make an impact
* Confident – they’re comfortable in face to face sales discussions and gain trust through great service
* Compassionate – they understand the needs of their customers and how to best serve them

You’ll love this job because of our culture and the opportunity you’ll have to work directly with good people making real change in the world. The team at ThinkShout values working together because we’ve created a supportive environment where we can share our expertise and learn from each other. You’ll appreciate and enjoy the work because you believe in the missions of the nonprofits and organizations we serve. The time you invest into the nonprofits we serve will have a significant impact locally, throughout the country and around the world. You’ll go home at night knowing you used energy and skills for something you can be proud of.
