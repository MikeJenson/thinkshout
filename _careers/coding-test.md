In order to evaluate your Drupal skills, we'd like you to write a simple Drupal 8 module that satisfies the following requirements:

* The module can be enabled and run on any standard Drupal 8 installation without requiring additional modules.
* Create a form implemented using Drupal's Form API containing at least the following elements.
  * Text input field for a number.
  * A second text input field for a number.
  * A submit button
* When the form is submitted, it should return the sum of the 2 numbers in a standard Drupal message or elsewhere on the page.
* Have a normal menu item that can live in the standard navigation or main menu that links to the form.

_Extra credit:_

* Validate the form input to ensure the values are numeric.
* Use AJAX to show the calculated value when the user is completing the form (in addition to the message on submission).
* Write an automated test to ensure the numbers are added correctly.

Please post the module code to GitHub or a Drupal.org sandbox project. Feel free to include your thoughts about why you took the approach you did, what was easy or hard or other feedback. While there is no time limit on the test, how long it took to complete, measured from first to last commit, will be a factor.

Good luck and thanks for your interest!
