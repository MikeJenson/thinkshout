bio: |
  Brittany’s been managing web projects for over five years. She's proven that she’s not afraid of a challenge, as evidenced by the web agency she founded in 2011. Prior to entering the web world, she worked in marketing and public relations. She credits her marketing and PR background for her ability to empathize with clients and communicate the importance of storytelling and content strategy. She believes that relationship management and setting your intentions up front are the recipe for success, and we don’t disagree. Outside of work, Brittany enjoys spending her time throwing themed parties with her friends, and exploring the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest with her dog Suki.
