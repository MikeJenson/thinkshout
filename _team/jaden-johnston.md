bio: |
  Jaden’s expertise in project management, sales operations, and marketing make her an integral part of our business development team, helping us stay on task while making sure we are meeting the standards of excellence we set for ourselves as we work with our clients. She joined the ThinkShout team for the opportunity to assist cause-oriented organizations and could combine her experience in the technology and nonprofit sectors. Jaden studied political science and multimedia, and has summited Mount St. Helens three times. It’s not an “overcoming challenges” metaphor. She literally climbed this mountain three times.
