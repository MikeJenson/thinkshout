  What began as dabbling in Photoshop 5.5, creating drop shadow-heavy posters for his metal band in 2002, turned into a UX career for Josh. He now works with exciting new technologies to build memorable user experiences for our clients.

bio: |
  Josh was attracted to ThinkShout because of our commitment to serving nonprofits. He puts his design skills to work for organizations doing good in the world, and we are more than happy to help him achieve that goal. He designs in the browser, using tools we love like Sass and Jekyll, and doesnâ€™t shy away from large, responsive web challenges. Before ThinkShout (and after the metal band), Josh worked remotely from Florida as a designer at Lullabot. He has since relocated to Portland with his wife and spends his free time hiking, cooking, or honing his photography skills.
