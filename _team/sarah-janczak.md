  Sarah defines adventure as pushing yourself to try new things, things that you’re afraid of, that end up having a positive effect. That's just the type of positive attitude we like to see in our team members.

bio: |
Sarah comes from a long line of NTEN alumni (two other ThinkShouters were previously at NTEN). It was in her role there that she not only fell in love with nonprofit strategy but also with the nonprofit community itself and the idea of leveraging technology to help the greater good. Hearing about how nonprofits are innovating with limited resources to do the most good is inspiring to her. This role involved a lot of relationship management, a skill that will serve her well as an account manager for us at ThinkShout.

When she’s not working, Sarah writes and publishes poems and dog, Nadia serves as an incredible diligent proofreader! But the most adventurous thing? But lately her sense of adventure has turned to other hobbies -- namely lifting weights and working with a trainer, activities she’s never attempted before. “To me, that’s the definition of adventure - pushing yourself to try new things, things that you’re afraid of, that end up having a positive effect.”
