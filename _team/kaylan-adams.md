bio: |
  Kaylan might be a familiar face to some. She worked for ThinkShout from 2014-2016; and then took two years off to be home with her daughter. Lucky for us, she missed the clients, projects and internal team so much that she decided to come back. We love the diversity of her experience and her unwavering enthusiasm for each project she oversees. She has a Master's degree in English literature and is a self-proclaimed research nut. She also really, really loves marine mammals and used to volunteer for the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in Los Angeles as a whale watch tour guide. Outside of her passion for project management and marine mammals, she and her husband love to host theme parties; which will no doubt make her an essential asset to our team.
