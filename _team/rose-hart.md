  Rose is a geek for problem solving; she loves taking concepts and turning them into plans of action. She’s an even bigger geek for Harry Potter, and claims to have actually found a Harry Potter-themed bar in Toronto. We hope it's easier to find than Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.

bio: |
  Rose came to ThinkShout with an extensive background in nonprofit communications. She spent several years on United Way of the Columbia-Willamette's marketing and communications team, which prepared her well for her role here. She never ceases to be inspired by the projects she manages and the missions of the organizations we get to partner with. She strives to ensure that the work we deliver makes our clients feel like they have the tools they need to achieve their goals, and open up possibilities for the future. When she’s not ensuring that we’re meeting deadlines, she’s making appearances at local comic cons, or binge watching Doctor Who.
