 Cooper loves open source as much as he loves Portland. He’s got an eye for close-to-the-metal details, user experience, and has a calling to do good in the world. We couldn’t hire him fast enough.

bio: |
 Cooper genuinely enjoys examining exotic data structures and learning new languages. He’s been coding since 1997, when he first picked up a book on HTML. He comes to us from Dartmouth College, where he specialized in media production and media archival software. Now, he’s helping us build websites for our nonprofit clients. His hobbies are as many as they are diverse, ranging from reading classical literature, performing in a rock band, and playing a half-orc fairy sorcerer rogue in Dungeons and Dragons. He's currently reading the Italian translation of Moby Dick just for the heck of it.
