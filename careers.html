    <h3>More About Us</h3>
      <p>
        We lead with technical excellence, innovation, and sustainable business
        practices. We focus on interesting projects that lead to open source
        contributions that serve grassroots organizers and progressive causes.
        We are maintainers of many popular Drupal modules such as the MailChimp
        and Salesforce Integration suites, as well as RedHen CRM. We’ve got our
        finger on the pulse of the open source community and we contribute back
        daily with updates and new tools designed to make everyone’s development
        process easier.
      </p>
      <p id="more-about-us-bold">We have distilled the following vision for our business:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Invest in the most talented technologists, project managers, and designers possible.</li>
        <li>Work with clients committed to positive social change.</li>
        <li>Don't compromise on tools, process, or quality.</li>
        <li>Work hard, have fun, and give back.</li>
      </ul>
