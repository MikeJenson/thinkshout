blurb: |
  Users experience nonprofits across channels, not departments. Every interaction is an opportunity to increase their engagement – or lose their support entirely. We help our clients break information out of silos and flow across their distributed third-party systems. We understand constituent management systems so well, we even developed our own.

Site visitors expect more from nonprofit websites these days. They’ve been trained by big brands with huge budgets to expect mobile-friendly experiences and content relevant to their own interests.

While nonprofit budgets can’t always compete, we help our clients leverage the power of open source to create immersive experiences for their constituents. In our hands, Drupal becomes a hub of engagement, pulling data from our clients’ CRMs and email lists to create experiences for end users that rival what they find on sites that cost far more.

#### Constituent Relationship Management (CRM)

Every nonprofit needs a way to track interactions with its constituents – and this information needs to be available to multiple staff members, wherever they happen to be. If a volunteer coordinator meets a donor at an event, and that donor expresses an interest in becoming a sustainer, the appropriate person in the development department needs to know. By tracking the history of engagement with constituents, nonprofits can better serve their needs.

ThinkShout’s understanding of nonprofit CRM is unmatched. Not only do we maintain the canonical Drupal integration with Salesforce, but we built RedHen - our own native CRM framework directly in Drupal.

RedHen is designed to meet common nonprofit needs, but built for flexibility. It has classic CRM functionality for managing information about contacts, organizations, and their relationships between each other and your organization. Although it's a fully-functional, self-contained lightweight CRM, RedHen is also designed to be an ideal integration point to enterprise CRM solutions like Salesforce or Blackbaud.

#### Third Party System Integration

We know it’s not always possible to build every feature our clients need into a single Drupal-based platform. Business needs and the accumulated accretions of history and technical debt dictate that many projects require us to create a cohesive experience across multiple platforms.

We have built a reputation for technical excellence in integrating with third party systems. ThinkShout maintains the canonical Drupal modules for Salesforce, MailChimp, and IATs – and we have experience integrating with other CRM and donation processing platforms.

By using Drupal as a hub for the information collected from these third party systems, we can build seamless user experiences that allow our clients to build deeper engagement with their constituents.

#### Digital Experience Management

Digital Experience Management (DEM) is the future of the Internet – but also its very real present. By defining and tracking a user’s actions online, their experience can be customized – even personalized – resulting in increased engagement. This can include everything from presenting more relevant content to making donation requests more meaningful to offering discounts on select events.

Similarly, as online fundraising tools and other public-facing features become more robust, it is critical that the choice of CMS and CRM platforms take into consideration a site visitor’s personalized experience when engaging with the site.

We partner with our clients to explore the evolution of digital experience management, its impact on constituent engagement, and tools and techniques to tie it all together. Armed with our open source toolkit, our clients can create personalization across user interactions with their website – and beyond.

Regardless of the scope of our engagement, we understand that no website is an island; rather, it is the hub of your entire digital ecosystem. As such, it is critical to understand how all the pieces work together.

We will document the systems in play in your organization’s current digital ecosystem, including their purpose and how information moves between them. We then present a concept for what a more effective and efficient future ecosystem will look like with the ultimate goal of creating a system that makes your job easier and more effective.
