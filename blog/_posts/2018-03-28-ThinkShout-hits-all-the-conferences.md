It unfolded like a sitcom. You know, the one where someone promises two separate people to be their date to the dance at school. It’s gonna end badly for everyone.

Well, we saw it coming and knew it sounded like an ill-informed idea, yet just like in a sitcom, we went ahead with it anyway. We’re sending teams to DrupalCon AND the #18NTC; mostly because they both got scheduled in the same week.

(hey y’all, let’s plan ahead next year.)

### NTC

We're heading to New Orleans for a week of jam-packed nonprofit goodness. The fun kicks off on April 10th with a pre-con event,Drupal Day:

[Agenda Here!](http://ntcdrupalday.org/)

We're still  looking for lightning talk speakers so [contact us](mailto:natania.leclerc@thinkshout.com) if you have a hot topic you want to share. Lightning talks are traditionally 5 minutes in length, and can cover any topic ranging from Drupal to nonprofit life to lessons learned and funny predicaments involving all of the above!

Brett Meyer and Jessica Tate will also be dropping some knowledge during the conference itself. Mark your calendars so you don't miss their talks:

[Supporting Culture with Multicultural Design](https://www.nten.org/ntc/program/sessions/supporting-diversity-with-multicultural-design/?mc_cid=997b26a472&mc_eid=[UNIQID])

[Content Strategy in Popular Culture](https://www.nten.org/ntc/program/sessions/content-strategy-in-popular-culture-2/?mc_cid=997b26a472&mc_eid=[UNIQID])

And no NTC would be complete without some ThinkShout classic tees! We’ll be handing out these beauties at our booth (number 606). We went with a 70s-inspired design this year, and they’ll give you all the posi-vibes you need.

### DrupalCon

They said it couldn’t be done...so naturally we took on the challenge! A handful of our team will also be in Nashville for DrupalCon.

Join us for the [Nonprofit Summit](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/nonprofit-summit), where Gabe Carleton-Barnes will give you the scoop on [Bene](https://thinkshout.com/bene/), the distro we released this winter. We’re also sponsoring a [Women in Drupal](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/women-drupal_) reception on April 10th. We'll be handing out t-shirts at both events, so head there early to grab yours while supplies last!

All joking about conference logistics aside, we truly appreciate every opportunity to connect with the nonprofit tech community. It's a chance to hear more about the inspiring work being done in the world. If you'd like to sit with us and talk about what we can do for your digital presence, [let us know](hello@thinkshout.com), we look forward to hearing from you!
